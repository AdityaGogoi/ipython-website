IPython: An Interactive Computing Environment
=============================================

The goal of IPython is to create a comprehensive environment for
interactive and exploratory computing.  To support, this goal, IPython
has two main components:

	- An enhanced interactive Python shell.
	- An architecture for interactive parallerel computing.

All of IPython is open source (released under the revised BSD license). You can
see what projects are using IPython `here <project.html>`_, or check out the
`talks and presentations <presentation.html>`_ we have given about IPython.  

IPython supports Python 2.5 and 2.6 officially.  If you need to use Python 2.4,
the 0.10 series probably works OK but has not been extensively tested with 2.4.

An *experimental* Python 3 port has been started recently.  The code is
currently only available 
`in source form from github <http://github.com/ipython/ipython-py3k>`_ but we
welcome testing, contributions and improvements. Please join the 
`IPython developers list <http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev>`_
to participate!

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Citing IPython
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Several of the authors of IPython are connected with academic and scientific research, so it is important to us to be able to show the impact of our work in other projects and fields.

If IPython contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication, please acknowledge this fact by citing the project, you can see `CitingIPython <citing.html>`_ for a ready-made citation entry.  We have a listing of `projects using IPython <project.html>`_, for which updates are always also welcome.

Announcements
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - **Development Version:** what will be 0.11 is taking shape, but lots of changes are coming (including some that break compatibility).  We would like your feedback, from either the `nightly documentation <http://ipython.scipy.org/doc/nightly/html/whatsnew/development.html>`_ or `source tarball <http://github.com/ipython/ipython/tarball/master>`_ (you can also follow the trunk from `GitHub <http://github.com/ipython/ipython>`_).
 - **Stable Version:** 0.10.2, released on April 9, 2011.


More news about IPython can be found `here <news.html>`_.


~~~~~~~~
Download
~~~~~~~~
If you just want to grab IPython, this `page <download.html>`_ has direct links
to downloads of the latest version in various formats, and you can always access
the download directory with all previous versions `here <download.html>`_.


Or, for those who prefer the bleeding edge, the development version of IPython
can be downloaded from our `GitHub repository <http://github.com/ipython/ipython>`_
using `Git <http://git-scm.com>`_:

Please note that currently, the IPython trunk is undergoing significant changes
and APIs are changing. So unless you keep tabs on the development mailing list,
you may find a few surprises if you update from our GitHub sources frequently.

``git clone git://github.com/ipython/ipython.git``

Hosting
~~~~~~~
IPython has been generously hosted by `Enthought <http://enthought.com/>`_ almost since its inception.  We also use `GitHub <http://github.com/>`_ and `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ for code hosting and distributed version control.
